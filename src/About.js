            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Welcome! I am currently a freelance Front End Web Developer. I'm presently very interested in improving coding speed through emmet, SCSS and REACT. I'd like to eventually write code to save work for other people. I create responsive and accesible websites while working in teams, pairs or alone. I graduated from Juno school of Technology which is one of the highest rated front end programs in Canada.</p> 
                
            <p> In my spare time I like to record music and play Dota as a position 5 or 3 and I'm currently saving for a dog! Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Thank you.</p>
