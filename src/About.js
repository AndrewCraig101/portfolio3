                <p>Welcome! I'm Front End Web Developer based in Toronto. I do responsive and accessible programming working in HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and React. I'm currently developing a coding curriculum for beginners that involves a deep dive of Emmet, VS Code and SCSS. I believe if the fundamentals are taught early, people can code faster! 
                </p>
                <p> In my spare time I play guitar, read sci fi and sometimes act in plays. Let's get some work done!</p>
