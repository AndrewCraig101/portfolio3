                <p>Welcome! I'm Front End Web Developer based in Toronto, CA. I do responsive and accessible programming working in SCSS/HTML, Javascript and React. I'm currently developing a coding curriculum for beginners that involves a deep dive of Emmet, VS Code and SCSS. I believe if the fundamentals are taught early, people can code faster!</p>
                <p>In my spare time I play guitar, read sci fi and am currently saving for a dog. I'm also a devout bunzer :D Let's get some work done!</p>
